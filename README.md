# DBMS-Project
It is our project where we are managing a database of all hotels of a given area using MySQL.
Hotel management system is a system that provides us the facility  reserving rooms, checking whether the rooms are vacant in a given hotel or not etc by using online browsing.
We can browse the list of hotels in a particular location and also compare their prices.We can also select the type of rooms we want to book in a given hotel.
Such kind of Databse systems help people to save their time by selecting best hotel according to their needs.Online booking of  hotels is possible by using this.
